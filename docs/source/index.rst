``torch::deploy`` [Beta]
=====================

``torch::deploy``  (MultiPy for non-PyTorch use cases) is a C++ library that enables you to run eager mode PyTorch models in production without any modifications to your model to support tracing. ``torch::deploy`` provides a way to run using multiple independent Python interpreters in a single process without a shared global interpreter lock (GIL).
For more information on how ``torch::deploy`` works please see the related `arXiv paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00254.pdf>`_.

The most up to date installation instructions for ``torch::deploy`` can be found in our `README <https://github.com/pytorch/multipy>`__.
